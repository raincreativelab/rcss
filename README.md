<h1>RCSS - A PHP CSS Pre-processor</h1>
<p>It's time to take a break</p>
<p>From writing old school CSS and jump to the wonderful world of CSS pre-processor. Don't worry, we won't let you commit yet. For now, why don't you check it out, learn and play with it. Soon once, we have sorted out the bugs we will let you take it for a spin.</p>

<p>RCSS is in private beta, and I want to make sure I covered all the basic before making it in public.
If you found issues on any of the code, please submit it so that I can start resolving it.</p>
